//? why do we need to use binary exponentiation?
// The brute force approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the exponent.
// This is inefficient for large values of n, as it requires n multiplications.
// Binary exponentiation reduces the time complexity to O(log n) by using the properties of exponents.
// It works by breaking down the exponentiation into smaller parts, allowing us to compute the result more efficiently.
// Binary Exponentiation using Bit Manipulation
// Time Complexity: O(log n) where n is the exponent
// Space Complexity: O(1) as we are using constant space for the result and x

//? why are using the above while loop?
// we are doing exponentiation by squaring
// this is an efficient way to calculate power
// how it works:
// we can express the power in binary form
// for example, 13 in binary is 1101, which means:
// 13 = 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0
// so we can calculate the power by multiplying the base raised to the power of each bit that is set to 1
// if the bit is 0, we skip that power
// this reduces the number of multiplications needed
// time complexity: O(log n) where n is the exponent
// space complexity: O(1) as we are using constant space for the result and x
// if n is negative, we take the reciprocal of x and make n positive
// we use a loop to iterate through the bits of n
// if the current bit is 1, we multiply the result by x
// we square x for the next bit
// we right shift n by 1 to process the next bit
// this way, we efficiently calculate the power in logarithmic time
// this is known as exponentiation by squaring
